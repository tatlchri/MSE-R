# Maximum Score Estimator

This code was designed by Theodore Chronis and Christina Tatli in collaboration with Denisa Mindruta.

The code builds upon Jeremy Fox’s theoretical work on the “pairwise maximum score estimator” (Fox 2010; Fox 2016) and the original Match Estimation toolkit (Santiago and Fox, 2009) which can be downloaded from http://fox.web.rice.edu/

To understand the present code the user needs to be familiar with the maximum score estimator and formal matching games. To ease the exposition, this documentation and the code itself follow closely the terminology used by Jeremy Fox. Unless stated otherwise, please refer back to the original sources for definitions and technical details accessible via the links at the bottom of this document.  

## Installation Instructions

1. Download the zip file (https://github.com/tatlchri/MSE-R/archive/master.zip)

2. Extract the downloaded compressed file MSE-R-master.zip

3. Install the libraries: knitr, tinytex

4. Install libxml2-devel in your OS. ie. in Fedora Linux sudo dnf install libxml2-devel

5. For Knit, that is pdf exporting install texlive-titling, texlive-framed in your OS.

6. Goto examples/ and open any of the examples to experiment with specific cases

7. Make sure you have set the correct library path at the beginning of your notebooks


## Documentation

A full description of all upgrades can be found under doc/MSE-R.docx

The code is broken down to several files that are all tied together through the main library file **mse.R** , which must be loaded before calling any MSE function described in doc/functions-reference.docx
